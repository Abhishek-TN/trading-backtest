# Trading Strategy Backtesting

This project implements a backtesting system for a trading strategy using **Bollinger Bands**. The system processes historical price data, applies the strategy, simulates trades, and visualizes the backtest results through a web application.

## Project Overview
This project applies the **Bollinger Bands** strategy to simulate trading decisions and backtest performance. The backtest evaluates buy and sell signals generated by the interaction of price with Bollinger Bands:
- **Buy Signal**: When the price crosses below the lower Bollinger Band and then crosses back above it.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price crosses above the upper Bollinger Band and then crosses back below it.

After the backtest, the results are visualized using a web application.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

## Installation
1. Unzip the provided folder and navigate to the project directory.
   
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file includes the following libraries:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - dash
    - plotly
    - requests (for data ingestion)

## Steps to Run the Code

1. **Fetch Historical Data**: First, you need to fetch the historical data that will be used in the backtest. Run the following script to download the required data:
    ```bash
    python fetch_data.py
    ```
    This script will fetch the historical price data (e.g., stock or crypto data) and save it into the `data/` directory in CSV format.

2. **Run the Backtest**: Once the data is fetched, you can proceed with running the backtest:
    ```bash
    python backtest.py
    ```
    This will:
    - Process the historical data.
    - Apply the Bollinger Bands strategy.
    - Perform the backtest.
    - Save the results to a file or database.

3. **Visualize the Results**: After the backtest is complete, you can visualize the results in a web application. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    This will launch a local web server where you can see the backtest results:
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the visualization.

## Backtesting Logic
The backtesting logic uses the Bollinger Bands strategy:
- **Buy Signal**: When the price crosses below the lower Bollinger Band.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price crosses above the upper Bollinger Band.

The backtesting script calculates metrics like:
- Total profit/loss
- Maximum profit
- Minimum profit
- Number of trades

## Visualization
Once the backtest is complete, the results are visualized using Dash, a web framework. The visualization includes:
- A plot showing the price and Bollinger Bands.
- A table of performance statistics, such as total profit, maximum profit, and number of trades.

# Trading Backtest Project

## Objective:
This project implements a backtesting system for a trading strategy using **Bollinger Bands**. The goal is to:
1. **Ingest historical trading data**.
2. **Apply the Bollinger Bands strategy** to simulate trading decisions.
3. **Backtest** the trading strategy to evaluate its performance.
4. **Visualize** the performance and results of the strategy using a web application.

## File Breakdown:

### 1. `fetch_data.py`:
This script handles the data ingestion process. It fetches historical stock market data from an external source or API and prepares it for analysis. The data includes stock prices (Open, Close, High, Low) and is formatted for use in the next steps.

### 2. `strategy.py`:
The core logic of the **Bollinger Bands strategy** is implemented here. The script calculates the following:
   - **Middle Band**: A moving average (typically 20 periods).
   - **Upper Band**: The middle band + (2 * standard deviation).
   - **Lower Band**: The middle band - (2 * standard deviation).

The strategy works by generating **Buy** and **Sell** signals based on the stock price's interaction with the Bollinger Bands:
   - **Buy Signal**: When the price crosses below the lower band and then crosses back above it.
   - **Sell Signal**: When the price crosses above the upper band and then crosses back below it.

### 3. `backtest.py`:
This script contains the **backtesting logic**, where trades are simulated based on the strategy's signals. It tracks the portfolio value by applying the buy and sell decisions over historical data and calculates profit/loss for each trade. Key functionalities include:
   - **Simulating Trades**: The system mimics real-world trading decisions.
   - **Tracking Portfolio**: Updates portfolio value based on executed trades.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Calculates key metrics like total return and percentage return for evaluating the strategy's performance.

### 4. `app.py` and `frontend`:
Once the backtesting results are calculated, the code uses visualization techniques to present them:
   - **Charting**: Price data and Bollinger Bands are plotted using libraries like `matplotlib` or `plotly`.
   - **Web Interface**: A simple web application displays interactive charts and performance metrics to allow users to analyze and modify the backtesting strategy.

## How It Works:

1. **Data Ingestion**: The script `fetch_data.py` fetches the historical stock data from a data source.
2. **Strategy Implementation**: In `strategy.py`, Bollinger Bands are calculated, and buy/sell signals are generated.
3. **Backtesting**: The trading decisions are simulated in `backtest.py` over the historical data, and performance is tracked.
4. **Visualization**: The results are visualized in a web application built with `app.py`, presenting charts that display portfolio performance and strategy results.

## Features:
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves stock market data from an external source.
- **Bollinger Bands Strategy**: Implements a simple yet effective trading strategy using Bollinger Bands.
- **Backtesting**: Simulates trades based on historical data and calculates the resulting performance.
- **Web Visualization**: Presents the backtest results in an interactive web interface, allowing easy analysis.

## Running the Code:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure that the required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
